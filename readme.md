Modeller (tentative title) - 0.1.2 4/3/13

A logic modeling tool in development by Duncan Alexander (duncan@hypothete.com) and Lindsey Smith.

This is a Meteor v0.57 web app that includes the following smart packages:
* Accounts-Password
* Accounts-UI
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* Backbone (currently unused, planned)
* Meteor-X-Editable-Bootstrap (download here: https://github.com/nate-strauser/meteor-x-editable-bootstrap)
* Preserve-Inputs

To run Modeller, you must have an install of Meteor that is v0.57 or older. In the command prompt, navigate to the root folder and run meteor. Modeller will be displayed in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

The current version of the software has a bug in how Session variables are set and updated. Occasionally you may need to refresh the page and re-select your model from the Models dropdown.
